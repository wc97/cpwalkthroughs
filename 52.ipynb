    "\n",
    "The major feature you want in your hash function is collision-resistance. That is, it should be hard to generate collisions, and it should be really hard to generate a collision for a given hash (aka preimage).\n",
    "\n",
    "Iterated hash functions have a problem: the effort to generate lots of collisions scales sublinearly.\n",
    "\n",
    "What's an iterated hash function? For all intents and purposes, we're talking about the Merkle-Damgard construction. It looks like this:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "function MD(M, H, C):\n",
    "  for M[i] in pad(M):\n",
    "    H := C(M[i], H)\n",
    "  return H\n",
    "```   \n",
    "<br>    \n",
    "    \n",
    "For message `M`, initial state `H`, and compression function `C`.\n",
    "\n",
    "This should look really familiar, because SHA-1 and MD4 are both in this category. What's cool is you can use this formula to build a makeshift hash function out of some spare crypto primitives you have lying around (e.g. `C = AES-128`).\n",
    "\n",
    "Back on task: the cost of collisions scales sublinearly. What does that mean? If it's feasible to find one collision, it's probably feasible to find a lot.\n",
    "\n",
    "How? For a given state `H`, find two blocks that collide. Now take the resulting hash from this collision as your new H and repeat. Recognize that with each iteration you can actually double your collisions by subbing in either of the two blocks for that slot.\n",
    "\n",
    "This means that if finding two colliding messages takes `2^(b/2)` work (where `b` is the bit-size of the hash function), then finding `2^n` colliding messages only takes `n*2^(b/2)` work.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's test it. First, build your own MD hash function. We're going to be generating a LOT of collisions, so don't knock yourself out. In fact, go out of your way to make it bad. Here's one way:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Take a fast block cipher and use it as `C`.\n",
    "2. Make `H` pretty small. I won't look down on you if it's only 16 bits. Pick some initial `H`.\n",
    "3. `H` is going to be the input key and the output block from `C`. That means you'll need to pad it on the way in and drop bits on the way out.\n",

    "One of the basic yardsticks we use to judge a cryptographic hash function is its resistance to second preimage attacks. That means that if I give you `x` and `y` such that `H(x) = y`, you should have a tough time finding `x'` such that `H(x') = H(x) = y`.\n",

    "> __Abstract.__  We expand a previous result of Dean [Dea99] to provide asecond preimage attack on alln-bit iterated hash functions with Damg ̊ard-Merkle strengthening andn-bit intermediate states, allowing a secondpreimage to be found for a 2k-message-block message with aboutk ×2n/2+1+2n−k+1 work. Using RIPEMD-160 as an example, our attack canfind a second preimage for a 2^60 byte message in about 2^106 work, rather than the previously expected 2^160 work. We also provide slightly cheaperways to find multicollisions than the method of Joux [Jou04]. Both of these results are based on expandable messages–patterns for producing messages of varying length, which all collide on the intermediate hash result immediately after processing the message. We provide an algorithm for finding expandable messages for any n-bit hash function built usingthe Damgard-Merkle construction, which requires only a small multiple of the work done to find a single collision in the hash function.\n",

    "Sometimes people try to use CBC-MAC as a hash function.\n",

    "This is a bad idea. Matt Green explains:\n",
    "\n",
    "> To make a long story short: cryptographic hash functions are public functions (i.e., no secret key) that have the property of collision-resistance (it's hard to find two messages with the same hash). MACs are keyed functions that (typically) provide message unforgeability -- a very different property. Moreover, they guarantee this only when the key is secret. \n",
    "\n",
    "Let's try a simple exercise.\n",
    "\n",
    "Hash functions are often used for code verification. This snippet of JavaScript (with newline):\n",
    "    \n",
    "```\n",
    "alert('MZA who was that?');\n",
    "```   \n",
    "</br>    \n",

    "Hashes to `296b8d7cb78a243dda4d0a61d33bbdd1` under CBC-MAC with a key of `YELLOW SUBMARINE` and a `0` IV.\n",
    "\n",
    "Forge a valid snippet of JavaScript that alerts `Ayo, the Wu is back!` and hashes to the same value. Ensure that it runs in a browser.\n",

    "\n",
    "    \n",
    "`e=3` is secure as long as we can make assumptions about the message blocks we're encrypting. The worry with low-exponent RSA is that the message blocks we process won't be large enough to wrap the modulus after being cubed. The block `00:02` (imagine sufficient zero-padding) can be \"encrypted\" in `e=3` RSA; it is simply `00:08`.\n",
    "\n",
    "When RSA is used to sign, rather than encrypt, the operations are reversed; the verifier \"decrypts\" the message by cubing it. This produces a \"plaintext\" which the verifier checks for validity.\n",

    "\n",
    "This is a bug because it implies the verifier isn't checking all the padding. If you don't check the padding, you leave open the possibility that instead of hundreds of ffh bytes, you have only a few, which if you think about it means there could be squizzilions of possible numbers that could produce a valid-looking signature.\n",
